# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)
Explore the DSA folder to find various programs that cover fundamental data structures and algorithms. From arrays to trees, queues to stacks, these snippets aim to help you understand and implement key concepts in the world of programming.

Trees: Check out the Trees directory for implementations of tree data structures and related algorithms.

Queue: Discover the Queue folder for code snippets showcasing queue implementations and their applications.

Stack: Dive into the Stack directory to explore stack data structures and how they can be used in different scenarios.

# Projects
The Projects directory contains a couple of hands-on coding projects I've crafted. Each project is a playground to apply DSA concepts and build something cool.

Feel free to browse the code, tinker with it, and use it as a resource for your own coding journey.
